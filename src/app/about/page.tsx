            My Leadership Philosophy
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            I believe that great engineering teams are built on three pillars: <strong>purpose</strong>, 
            <strong> empathy</strong>, and <strong>shared vision</strong>. When engineers understand not just 
            what they&apos;re building, but why it matters, they create solutions that truly serve users and 
            drive meaningful impact.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Why This Blog Exists</h2>
        
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          After years of leading engineering teams, I&apos;ve learned that the most challenging problems 
          aren&apos;t technical‚Äîthey&apos;re human. How do you foster a culture where people feel safe to 
          experiment and fail? How do you help teams find meaning in their work? How do you balance 
          shipping fast with building right?
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This blog is my attempt to share the insights, frameworks, and stories that have shaped 
          my approach to engineering leadership. Every post is written with the belief that great 
          software starts with great leadership, and great leadership starts with understanding 
          what truly motivates people.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">My Approach</h2>
        
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I write in the style of leaders I admire‚Äîlike <strong>Lara Hogan</strong> and 
          <strong> Simon Sinek</strong>‚Äîwho blend practical wisdom with human insight. 
          Every post starts with a story or analogy because I believe that&apos;s how we 
          learn best: through narrative and connection.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          My goal isn&apos;t to have all the answers, but to share the questions that have 
          shaped my thinking and the frameworks that have helped me grow as a leader. 
          I hope these posts spark conversations, challenge assumptions, and help you 
          build teams that don&apos;t just ship code‚Äîthey ship solutions that matter.
