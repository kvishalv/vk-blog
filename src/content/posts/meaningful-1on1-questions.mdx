Six months ago, I was sitting in yet another 1:1 with Alex, one of my senior engineers, when I realized something was wrong. Not with Alex—with me.

"How are things going?" I asked, for what felt like the hundredth time.

"Fine," Alex replied, for what was definitely the hundredth time.

We sat in awkward silence for what felt like an eternity. I could see Alex checking his phone under the table. I was mentally reviewing my calendar for the rest of the day. Neither of us was getting anything out of this conversation.

That's when it hit me: I was doing 1:1s completely wrong.

## The problem with "How are things going?"

The question "How are things going?" is the management equivalent of small talk. It's safe, it's easy, and it's completely useless.

Here's why it fails:

- **It's too vague** - People don't know what you're actually asking about
- **It invites surface-level responses** - "Fine" or "Good" don't tell you anything meaningful
- **It doesn't create psychological safety** - There's no indication that you actually want to hear the real answer
- **It wastes everyone's time** - Both of you leave the conversation feeling like you accomplished nothing

I was going through the motions of having 1:1s without actually having meaningful conversations. And my team was suffering because of it.

## The wake-up call

The wake-up call came when Alex finally broke the pattern. Instead of saying "fine," he looked me in the eye and said something that changed everything.

"We should move our 1:1s to monthly. I’m not sure I have anything new to say on a weekly basis."

Ouch.

But he was right. Our 1:1s had become a checkbox exercise. I was checking the "had 1:1" box, but I wasn't actually connecting with my team or understanding what they needed.

That conversation with Alex was the moment I realized I needed to completely rethink how I approached 1:1s.

## The framework that changed everything

Over the next few weeks, I researched, experimented, and developed a framework for asking questions that actually matter. Here's what I learned:

### 1. Questions that create psychological safety

The first category of questions is designed to create an environment where people feel safe to share what's really on their mind.

**Instead of:** "How are things going?"

**Try these:**

- "What's on your mind this week that I should know about?"
- "What's one thing that's been frustrating you lately?"
- "If you could change one thing about how we work, what would it be?"
- "What's something you wish I knew about your current situation?"

These questions signal that you're genuinely interested in their perspective and that you're prepared to hear things that might be uncomfortable.

### 2. Questions that uncover blockers and challenges

The second category helps you identify what's actually preventing your team from doing their best work.

**Instead of:** "Any blockers this week?"

**Try these:**

- "What's the biggest obstacle preventing you from doing your best work right now?"
- "If you had a magic wand and could remove one thing that's slowing you down, what would it be?"
- "What's something that's taking longer than it should, and why?"
- "What decision are you waiting for that's blocking your progress?"

These questions go deeper than surface-level blockers and help you understand the root causes of inefficiency.

### 3. Questions that reveal growth opportunities

The third category helps you understand how your team members want to develop and what support they need.

**Instead of:** "How can I help you grow?"

**Try these:**

- "What's a skill you'd like to develop that would make you more effective in your role?"
- "What's something you've been curious about but haven't had a chance to explore?"
- "If you could work on any project for the next month, what would it be and why?"
- "What's a challenge you'd like to tackle that would stretch your abilities?"

These questions help you understand not just what people want to learn, but why it matters to them.

### 4. Questions that strengthen relationships

The fourth category helps you build deeper connections with your team members.

**Instead of:** "How's work-life balance?"

**Try these:**

- "What's something outside of work that you're excited about right now?"
- "What's one thing I could do differently that would make your job easier?"
- "How do you prefer to receive feedback?"
- "What's your ideal way to celebrate a big win?"

These questions show that you care about them as people, not just as employees.

## The conversation that proved it worked

Three weeks after I started using this new framework, I had another 1:1 with Alex. This time, I came prepared with real questions.

"Alex, what's on your mind this week that I should know about?"

He paused for a moment, then said something that surprised me: "Actually, I've been thinking about our technical architecture, and I have some ideas I'd like to explore."

This was completely different from our previous conversations. Instead of the usual "fine" or "nothing much," Alex was excited to share something he'd been working on.

I followed up with another question from the framework: "What's something you've been curious about but haven't had a chance to explore?"

What followed was a completely different conversation. Alex shared that he'd been researching microservices patterns and had ideas about how we could improve our system's scalability. He'd been reading about event-driven architecture and wanted to prototype a new approach to our data pipeline.

He was energized, engaged, and had concrete ideas about how to make our team more effective. None of this would have come out with "How are things going?"

## The framework in action

Here's how I used the framework to support Alex's ideas:

### 1. Creating psychological safety
I thanked him for sharing his ideas and told him I was excited to hear more about his research.

### 2. Uncovering the real opportunities
I asked: "What's the biggest obstacle preventing you from exploring these ideas further?"

His answer: "I don't have time to prototype during regular work hours, and I'm not sure if this is something the team would be interested in."

### 3. Identifying growth opportunities
I asked: "What's a project you'd be excited to work on that would let you explore these architectural ideas?"

His answer: "I'd love to lead a proof-of-concept for the new data pipeline approach."

### 4. Strengthening our relationship
I asked: "What's one thing I could do differently that would make it easier for you to explore new ideas?"

His answer: "Give me dedicated time for research and experimentation, and involve me more in architectural decisions."

## The outcome

That conversation led to real changes:

- Alex became the technical lead for our new data pipeline proof-of-concept
- I allocated 20% of his time for research and experimentation
- We included him in all major architectural discussions
- He became one of our strongest technical innovators and mentors

But more importantly, it transformed how I approached 1:1s with my entire team.

## The questions that changed my team

Here are the specific questions I now use in every 1:1, organized by category:

### Opening questions (create safety)
- "What's on your mind this week that I should know about?"
- "What's one thing that's been frustrating you lately?"
- "What's something you're excited about in your work right now?"

### Deep-dive questions (uncover issues)
- "What's the biggest obstacle preventing you from doing your best work?"
- "What's a decision you're waiting for that's blocking your progress?"
- "What's something that's taking longer than it should, and why?"

### Growth questions (identify opportunities)
- "What's a skill you'd like to develop that would make you more effective?"
- "What's a challenge you'd like to tackle that would stretch your abilities?"
- "What's something you've been curious about but haven't explored?"

### Relationship questions (build connection)
- "What's one thing I could do differently that would make your job easier?"
- "How do you prefer to receive feedback?"
- "What's your ideal way to celebrate a big win?"

### Closing questions (ensure follow-through)
- "What's one thing you want to make sure we follow up on next time?"
- "Is there anything else you want to discuss that we haven't covered?"
- "What can I do to support you between now and our next 1:1?"

## The results

Since implementing this framework, I've seen dramatic improvements:

- **My team is more engaged** - They actually look forward to 1:1s instead of dreading them
- **I catch issues earlier** - Problems surface in 1:1s instead of becoming crises
- **People are more honest** - They feel safe to share what's really going on
- **Career development is more targeted** - I understand what people actually want to work on
- **Relationships are stronger** - I know my team members as people, not just employees

## The three principles that make it work

### 1. Ask open-ended questions
Questions that can be answered with "yes" or "no" don't create meaningful conversations. Ask questions that require thought and explanation.

### 2. Listen more than you talk
Your job in a 1:1 is to understand, not to be understood. Aim for a 70/30 ratio of listening to talking.

### 3. Follow up on what you learn
If someone shares something important, make sure you address it. Nothing kills trust faster than someone sharing a concern and then never hearing about it again.

## What this means for you

If you're struggling with 1:1s that feel like a waste of time, here's what I want you to know:

**The questions you ask determine the quality of the conversation.** Good questions create good conversations. Bad questions create bad conversations.

**Your team wants to be heard.** They have insights, concerns, and ideas that can make your team better. You just need to ask the right questions to uncover them.

**1:1s are an investment, not an expense.** The time you spend in meaningful 1:1s pays dividends in team engagement, retention, and performance.

**You don't have to be perfect.** Start with one or two good questions. Build from there. The important thing is to start asking questions that actually matter.

## The conversation that started it all

Looking back, I'm grateful that Alex was honest enough to tell me our 1:1s were pointless. That moment of uncomfortable truth was exactly what I needed to become a better manager.

If your 1:1s feel like Alex's did—like a checkbox exercise that nobody gets value from—it's time to change the questions you're asking.

Start with one good question. See what happens. Then add another. Before you know it, you'll be having conversations that actually matter.

Your team—and your leadership—will be better for it.
