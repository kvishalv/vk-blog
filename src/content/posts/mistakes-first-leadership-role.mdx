Three months into my first engineering management role, I was sitting in a 1:1 with Sarah, one of my most experienced engineers, when she dropped a bombshell: "I'm thinking about leaving."

My heart sank. Sarah was brilliant, had been at the company for three years, and was the kind of engineer who made everyone around her better. I had no idea what I'd done wrong, but clearly, I'd done something.

That conversation was the wake-up call I needed. Over the next few months, I made every mistake in the book—and learned from each one. Today, I want to share those hard-learned lessons with you.

## The mistake that almost cost me my best engineer
When Sarah told me she was considering leaving, my first instinct was to panic. But instead of asking the right questions, I immediately went into "fix it" mode. I started offering solutions before I understood the problem.

"I can get you more interesting projects," I said. "We can adjust your workload. What about a promotion?"

Sarah looked at me with a mix of frustration and disappointment. "You're not listening," she said quietly.

She was right. I wasn't listening. I was so focused on keeping her that I'd forgotten the most basic rule of leadership: understand before you act.

## What I learned about listening (the hard way)

That conversation taught me something crucial about engineering leadership: your job isn't to have all the answers. Your job is to understand the questions.

Sarah wasn't leaving because of projects or workload. She was leaving because she felt disconnected from the team's mission. She felt like her voice didn't matter in technical decisions. She was frustrated that we kept making the same architectural mistakes over and over.

None of my "solutions" addressed any of those real issues.

## The three listening mistakes I made (and how to avoid them)

### 1. I listened to respond, not to understand

When someone comes to you with a problem, your first job isn't to solve it. Your first job is to understand it completely.

**What I did wrong:** I heard "I'm thinking about leaving" and immediately started brainstorming retention strategies.

**What I should have done:** Asked open-ended questions like "Help me understand what's driving this decision" or "What would need to change for you to feel excited about staying?"

### 2. I assumed I knew what the problem was

I assumed Sarah was leaving because of compensation, career growth, or work-life balance. Classic management assumptions.

**What I did wrong:** I jumped to conclusions based on common retention issues.

**What I should have done:** Asked "What's the real issue here?" and then listened without judgment.

### 3. I tried to fix everything at once

Once I understood the real issues, I immediately wanted to solve all of them. Immediately.

**What I did wrong:** I created a massive action plan that overwhelmed both of us.

**What I should have done:** Focused on one or two key issues and made meaningful progress on those first.

## The conversation that changed everything

A week after that initial conversation, I asked Sarah if we could talk again. This time, I came prepared with questions, not solutions.

"Sarah, I realize I didn't listen well last time. Can you help me understand what's really going on?"

She looked surprised. "You want to know the real reason?"

"I do. And I promise I'll listen this time."

What followed was a two-hour conversation that completely changed how I thought about engineering leadership.

## The real issues (and why they matter)

Sarah wasn't leaving because of money or projects. She was leaving because:

1. **Technical decisions were being made without engineering input** - Product and business teams were making architectural decisions that affected our codebase without consulting the people who would have to live with those decisions.

2. **We had no clear technical vision** - Every project felt like a band-aid solution. There was no long-term thinking about how our systems should evolve.

3. **The team was becoming siloed** - Engineers were working in isolation, not collaborating or learning from each other.

4. **There was no growth path for senior engineers** - The most experienced people on the team felt like they were hitting a ceiling.

These weren't problems I could solve with a promotion or a new project. These were systemic issues that required fundamental changes to how we operated.

## How I started fixing things (and what I learned)

### 1. I stopped making technical decisions alone

This was the hardest change for me. As a new manager, I felt like I needed to have all the answers. But I realized that my job wasn't to make technical decisions—it was to facilitate good technical decisions.

**What I changed:** I started bringing the team together for technical discussions. Instead of making decisions in isolation, we made them as a group.

**The result:** Better decisions, more buy-in, and engineers who felt their expertise was valued.

### 2. I created space for technical vision

We started having regular "architecture review" sessions where the team could discuss long-term technical direction.

**What I changed:** Every month, we'd spend a few hours talking about where we wanted our systems to be in six months, a year, two years.

**The result:** Engineers started thinking strategically about their work, not just tactically.

### 3. I broke down the silos

I started pairing engineers on different projects, creating cross-team code reviews, and encouraging knowledge sharing.

**What I changed:** Instead of everyone working on their own features, we started working on shared problems.

**The result:** Better code quality, faster learning, and a more connected team.

### 4. I created growth opportunities for senior engineers

I started giving senior engineers more responsibility for mentoring, technical leadership, and strategic thinking.

**What I changed:** Senior engineers became technical leads, not just individual contributors.

**The result:** They felt more challenged and engaged, and the whole team benefited from their expertise.

## The outcome (and what it taught me)

Six months later, Sarah came into my office with a different kind of news.

"I'm staying," she said. "And I want to take on more technical leadership responsibilities."

That conversation was one of the proudest moments of my career. Not because I'd "solved" the retention problem, but because I'd learned to listen, understand, and lead in a way that actually served my team.

## The three principles that changed my leadership

### 1. Listen first, act second

Your job as a leader isn't to have all the answers. It's to understand the questions completely before you start looking for solutions.

### 2. Assume you don't know what the problem is

Even if you think you understand what's going on, ask questions. The real issue is often different from what you initially think.

### 3. Focus on systems, not symptoms

Individual problems are usually symptoms of systemic issues. Fix the system, and the individual problems often resolve themselves.

## What this means for you

If you're a new engineering manager, or if you're struggling with team issues, here's what I want you to know:

**You don't have to have all the answers.** In fact, trying to have all the answers is often the problem.

**Your job is to understand, not to fix.** Understanding comes first. Solutions come second.

**The real issues are usually systemic.** Look beyond the immediate problem to the underlying patterns.

**Your team knows more than you think.** They have the expertise. Your job is to create the space for that expertise to be shared and applied.

## The conversation that started it all

Looking back, I'm grateful for that difficult conversation with Sarah. It was painful, but it was also the moment I started becoming a real leader instead of just someone with a manager title.

If you're facing similar challenges, remember: the hard conversations are often the most important ones. Don't avoid them. Lean into them. Ask the difficult questions. Listen to the uncomfortable answers.

Your team—and your career—will be better for it.
